# audio-tools

These are a set of audio tools I have prepared over time for my own necessities.

## Players

### SqueezeLite

#### SqueezeLite 

#### SqueezeLite with discovery disabled

### Upnp-Renderer

## xfce-vnc

Allows to create a xfce-based vnc session with the possibility of installing upplay, pulseaudio and pulseaudio-dlna.  
This allows to use a browser to play to any dlna renderer easily, even from a windows desktop.
